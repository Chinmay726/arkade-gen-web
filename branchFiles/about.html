          <p>Arkade was founded be GamerX and Velocity , 
            in hope of creating an all in one bot..History of Arkade dates back to Velocity and GamerX making their seperate bots
            But then , we realised that , if we collaborate on one bot , we could be much better , so thats exactly what we did! Hence , Arkade was born.
            Before it was actually called arkade, it was called GamerX | .ghelp, it was a bot GamerX was developing for his server. Thats when we thought
            about collaborating and making a bot, The prefix was also .g but recently changed it to * . Our bot arkade, which is now a verified bot by discord
            and verified on other sites like top.gg. Make sure to vote arkade on top.gg, link is in the navigation bar above.
